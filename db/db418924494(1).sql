Before we met, I thought it would be easy and that we would intuitively understand each otherï¿½s wants and needs. It didn''t happen that way and I didn''t know why! I failed to consider many aspects of what it would be like to actually live with my soul mate. He had problems in a completely different way than I did, due to how he had been raised. Our different life experiences caused problems also. I couldn''t help thinking that if this was my soul mate, how could a relationship with a regular guy have more problems than with him?\r\n\r\nI looked up what a soul mate was and found some interesting information. A soul mate is a person who fills in all the gaps of your personality. I guess you would say that two soul mates are the yin and yang of a single person. Twin souls duplicate all of the personality traits of each other, including at times having the exact same experiences happen to them during their lifetime. I began to understand more of what I had been noticing about him and how our relationship worked. Twin flames are a variation upon twin souls but only together are the two people completed. Soul Mates can happen to clear up past karma and you can also be out of sync with a soul mate even if they exist in this lifetime.\r\n\r\nLiving with a soul mate is just as difficult as living with anyone else. Their personality faults and bad habits can drive you crazy. A soul mate is someone that you have bonded with in a past life. The soul connection can help you feel compassion even when they are at their very worst. Soul mates help their partners by expanding their viewpoints. They allow us to open ourselves up and see things in a different way. They feel in the gaps in experience we have by being included in their lives.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed traveling and have traveled all over the country but I was never one to go hear bands play or attend musical concerts. My soul mate plays instruments and can really sing. I have heard many great bands and appreciate more types of music than I had ever thought existed. I have had a great deal of fun and found out that I could sing also. I never would have experienced this and many other rewarding things in our relationship if I hadn''t met my soul mate. I have met another soul mate that I am out of sync with in this lifetime. Yet I would be a great deal poorer in love and experience if I had not met these people.</u></i>'),
